    "# What Makes a Great Dashboard (ACES)\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal dashboard is Accurate, Clear, Empowering, and Succinct. These key tenets can be remembered with the acronym ACES.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "A dashboard lives and dies by the trust the viewers have in what they are seeing. If the viewers doubt the accuracy it will not be used to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewers belief in the Accuracy of the dashboard can be affected in multiple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Quality: \n",
    "    - Is the data being displayed correct?\n",
    "    - How recently was the data last updated?\n",
    "- Metric Comprehension\n",
    "    - How easily digestible is the information?\n",
    "    - Does the dashboard include formulas, notes or definitions?\n",
    "- Visualization Design\n",
    "    - Everything from plotting data in R course\n",

    "## Clear\n",
