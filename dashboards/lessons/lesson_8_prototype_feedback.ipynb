    "First gather your documents stating the goal, decisions, and metrics in one place. Do a quick review to make sure you understand all the requirements of this dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it’s time to put pen to paper. In a typical design process the prototyping stage involves heavy divergent thinking to explore a wide range of solutions. In a dashboard design process the output is pretty heavily constrained to a few chart types. This means that you can start sketching pretty accurate designs right away.\n",

    "## Feedback\n",
    "You definitely want the Point Person’s feedback as to whether they think it would support their decisions. This is also a good time to bring in other members of the audience for feedback. There are a few easy tricks to helping the Point Person and audience give you helpful feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask the following questions for each visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do I need to know this?\n",
    "- What else do I want to know about this metric?\n",
    "- Is the conclusion I can draw from the visualization obvious?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask the following questions for the whole dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does this dashboard support the decisions and goals of this project?\n",
    "- Which visualization grabs your eye first? Should it?\n",
    "- Should any of these visualizations be grouped together?\n",
    "- Is anything missing from the dashboard?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Be open to feedback. **The goal is to create a useful dashboard for the audience, not to convince people your design is great**. You will likely need to do more than one round of prototyping, feedback, and iteration. After you get positive signals from the Point Person that if they had this dashboard it would help support their decisions to reach their goal you are ready to bring the chart to life."
