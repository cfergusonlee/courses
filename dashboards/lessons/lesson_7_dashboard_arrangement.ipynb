    "\n",
    "Arranging the charts is where the science of a dashboard project starts to cede some of its control to art. There are many things to consider when arranging and sizing charts and selecting fonts and colors. How visualizations are composed in a dashboard can either facilitate or hinder the decision making process."

    "In the dashboard that we have been working to create with this book, we ended up with thirteen individual charts, monitoring eight different metrics. Some metrics were monitored twice so the current status, as well as a trend analysis over time, could be analyzed. When we started to create the dashboard we ended up with thirteen charts in three zones. By grouping charts and metrics that are closely associated with each other it gives us a larger picture.\n",
