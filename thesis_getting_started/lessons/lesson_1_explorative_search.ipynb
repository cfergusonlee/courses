    "- Trade journals\n",

    "If you have an idea for a research topic, you should check to see if anyone else has already researched the same topic before you embark on your own research. For example if you are interested in researching the smoking habits of immigrants in Israel, you could enter smoking immigrants Israel in the search field and see if you discover any papers that resemble what you are thinking about researching. You could then consider whether the search results focus on what you would like to research or if your topic is different from the research already done.\n",

    "If you don’t find any articles that are very similar to your planned topic, then you probably have a novel idea. But the fact that your idea is novel doesn’t necessarily mean that it is a good idea. There may be good reasons that nobody has studied the topic before, for example that the subject is irrelevant.\n",

    "## Is my idea relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being novel, you must also have a clear feeling that your topic or your angle on your topic is relevant for anyone other than yourself as a student. Clarify this by using your explorative literature search to describe the specific problem – geographic, scope, extension – and to establish to yourself that your topic ties up with the nature of the problem, even if it is not measurable at this time. This work will hopefully bring you closer to a concrete description and argument of the aim of the thesis and why it is worth dealing with.\n",

    "## Is my question feasible?\n",
    "Once you have an idea for your research topic that appears to be novel and relevant, you should then consider whether it is feasible. E.g. will you be able to perform the research and write your thesis before its deadline?\n",

If you perform a search for articles written by this author, you can get a broader idea of what type of research the department is working on. You can perform this search in Pubmed or Google Scholar.
