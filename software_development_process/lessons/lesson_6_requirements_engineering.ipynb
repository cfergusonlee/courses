    "Software requirements basically provide us with a description of what a system has to do. Typically, they describe the funcitonality of the features that the system has to deliver in order to satisfy its stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements engineering includes but is not limited to:\n",
    "1. Working with stakeholders to elicit or to proactively discover what the requirements of the system are\n",
    "2. Analyzing the requirements to understand the tradeoffs and emerge conflicts\n",
    "3. Validating the software to ensure it covers the requirements\n",
    "4. Requirements management, which includes change management to account for changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens if we don't do requirements engineering right?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major reasons for a project failing is not getting the requirements right. We need to find the right group of stakeholders so we don't exclude major groups of stakeholders. We also need to make sure we understand the requirements correctly. Failing to satisfy any of the above criteria can set a software project on a faulty path, moving it away from its intended goal."
