    "1. **Efficient Program Development:** We want to build our product as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "2. **Systematic Building:** In order to ensure reliability, we need to be systematic.\n",
    "3. **Working with Stakeholders:** We need to be able to understand and work with our stakeholders to meet their needs.\n",
    "4. **Life Cycle:** The software lifecycle doesn't end after development. The majority of the budget is spent on maintenance and longevity.\n",
    "5. **Quality:** Does the product meet design specifications?\n",
    "6. **Envisioning and Realizing Value:** At its core, software engineering involves bringing an idea to fruition.\n",
    "7. **Meeting Requirements and Design Specifications:** Does the product do what it set out to do?\n",
    "7. **Scalability:** How efficient is the system? Can it be tweaked easily to meet new needs?\n",
    "7. **Reliability:** Does the system work consistently?\n",
    "8. **Safety and Security:** Does the system break easily? Is any sensitive information exposed?\n"
