    "- **Operations:** A set of methods that operate on the state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional object oriented language, we would say that operations are invoked by sending a message to the appropriate object, which is what we normally call a method invocation.\n",

We then underline adjectives to identify the attributes of those classes. We then focus on the active verbs, which give us the operations we need to define for our classes.\n",
