    "### Workspace\n",
    "Your workspace is where you store all of your projects. You shouldn't be changing its location. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Starting a Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Package:** Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist. Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called __init__.py. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module:** a piece of software that has a specific functionality. For example, when building a ping pong game, one module would be responsible for the game logic, and another module would be responsible for drawing the game on the screen. Each module is a different file, which can be edited separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each project within the workspace directory gets its own directory. Eclipse organizes everything into project folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 3.13.05 PM.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Eclipse creates a `.project` and `.pydevproject` file when creating a project. These are booking files that store information about the project configuration and project path, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 4.37.23 PM.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perspecive:** a predefined layout of views and editors. For example, the PyDev perspective is optimized for code editing while the Debugger perspective is optimized for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**View:** A view is typically used to work on a set of data. This data might be a hierarchical structure. If data is changed via the view, the underlying data is directly changed, without the need to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editor:** Editors are typically used to modify a single data element, e.g., the content of a file or a data object. Change in an editor are only applied once the user saves.\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src='../images/Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 3.51.06 PM.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Views and editors can be resized, repositioned within the IDE or moved outside the IDE.\n",
    "\n",

    "If we don't like the way a perspective is arranged, we can right click and reset it.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Writing Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To add modules (`.py` files) to a project, we can right click on the package and select \"new module\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 3.32.27 PM.png' />\n",

    "\n",
    "### Adding existing source code to a project\n",
    "\n",
    "To add existing code to your project, you can just drag and drop. Choosing copy is probably a safer and more intuitive option because it leaves the original intact and you don't have to worry about remembering where all of the linked modules live.\n",
