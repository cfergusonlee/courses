    "Developing is a lot more like driving a car than navigating a boat. We need to negotiate turns, pay attention to traffic conditions, and keep our eyes on the road. The environment changes rapidly and when we don't accomodate these changes appropriately, we can end up in an accident or drive off the road. We can also end up getting lost if we don't have a clear destination, but immediate concerns are often just as important if not more so than long-term concerns.\n",

    "- **Communication:** There is no good project without communication. In general, it's about constantly sharing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Strive to build the simplest product *that works*. Live for today without worrying too much about tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback:** It occurs at different level and is used to drive change. For example, developers write test cases, which is immediate feedback. If your test cases fail, there's something wrong with the code or there's something that you still haven't developed. Developers also estimate new stories as soon as they get them from the customer. Finally, on a slightly longer time frame, customers and testers develop functional system test cases to assess the overall system. In this case, that's a great way to provide feedback and help communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Courage:** It takes courage to throw away code if it doesn't work, change it if you find a way to improve it, fix it if you find a problem or try out new things if you think they might work better than what you have right now. Now that we can build systems much faster, we can afford to be more brave.\n",
