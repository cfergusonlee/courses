    "\n",
    "1. **Disambiguate based on assertion violation messages:** The simplest strategy is to simply examine assertion violation messages being generated and trace them back to the source.\n",
    "2. **Core dump or stack trace:** Slightly more challenging than an assertion violation, but same concept of tracing bug to source.\n",
    "3. **Search over version history:** If we're following the one feature per version protocol, we can see when bugs pop up by searching through the version history. This can help us quickly identify any new bugs in the codebase.\n",
    "4. **Examine bug-triggering test cases:** We can look at patterns in test cases that lead to failures.\n",
