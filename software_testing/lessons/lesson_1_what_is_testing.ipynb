    "When designing tests, we want to identify any assumptions we may have about our code and break them down as objectively as possible. A single test case represents a point in the input space that we're testing. The results of this test case can generalize to a subset of the input space. Good testing will increase our generalizatbility from a small subset to the majority of the input space. It takes critical thinking, however; to come up with enough test cases to fill this space properly.\n",

    "It's also probably a good idea to group tests based on the functionality being tested and printing a helpful error message when possible. For instance, we could create multiple tests within each test, but have each test only check one facet. The first test could check large and small values, the second test could check head wraparound functionality, the third could check tail wraparound functionality, etc. In the first exercise, they stuck to generic \"test1 OK\" and \"test2 NOT OK\" messages which required a bit of parsing to figure out what exactly went wrong.

    "# the constructor takes a single parameter: an integer > 0 that\n",
    "# is the maximum number of elements the queue can hold.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# empty() returns True if and only if the queue currently \n",
    "# holds no elements, and False otherwise.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# full() returns True if and only if the queue cannot hold \n",
    "# any more elements, and False otherwise.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# enqueue(i) attempts to put the integer i into the queue; it returns\n",
    "# True if successful and False if the queue is full.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# dequeue() removes an integer from the queue and returns it,\n",
    "# or else returns None if the queue is empty.\n",

    "# q = Queue(1)\n",
    "# is_empty = q.empty()\n",
    "# succeeded = q.enqueue(10)\n",
    "# is_full = q.full()\n",
    "# value = q.dequeue()\n",

    "# 2. Should then check whether q is empty, which should return True\n",
    "# 3. Should attempt to put 10 into the queue, and return True\n",
    "# 4. Should check whether q is now full, which should return True\n",
    "# 5. Should attempt to dequeue and put the result into value, which \n",
    "#    should be 10\n",
